# Description 


Have you ever wanted to have some fun with the diverse genres of the Indian music industry? You can explore the vibrant sounds of Bollywood, immerse yourself in the rhythmic beats of Bhangra, get lost in the soulful melodies of Sufi music, and so much more.The genre's which I have used are 
1.Patriotism,
2.Sad,
3.Dancepop,
4.Devotional,
5.Sufi  
6.Romantic.

With a simple drag and drop interface, you can mix and match different elements from various genres, creating your own musical compositions and witnessing the magic that happens when these genres blend together. It's a truly exciting and fun way to delve into the rich and diverse world of Indian music. So, why not give it a try and let your creativity soar with the endless possibilities this project has to offer!

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your desktop via terminal or access the live webpage via github-pages.
2. Once cloned/opened, navigate to the index.html file.

## Usage

1. Open up the puzzle game and drag the pieces over to their appropriate drop zone.
2. To double check functionality, use the relevant console present in the browser. 
3. For maximum enjoyment, rewrite the order of functions written in the JS file to see the other ways one can arrive to similar conclusions/conditions/solution.

## TODO:
The focus of this project is to collaboratively research, experiment with and ultimately design and build a multimedia application using
design and motion tools as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Your team will implement drag and drop functionality to load audio clips
and create a dynamic audio experience, trigger animation, and play a compiled audio track (see www.incredibox.com as a reference).
Try to implement this project in sprints - part of an agile workflow best practice. A sprint consists of a scoped mini-project that focuses
on one particular deliverable or feature. The work you do lives on a specific branch; everything required to complete that deliverable is
done on that branch and then merged to the main branch when finished.


## Assignment Requirements

Sprint 1: Setup, analysis and initial design
Set up the Github repo with a readme (make sure this is more than just the project name - refer to readme examples online). BOTH
team members should be contributing at this point - the designer can create the layout, generate the html and the css; the developer
should be researching functionality, creating JavaScript files, updating the HTML to add classes or other tools you might need to make
things work. Testing events, loading audio, etc can all happen here - it doesn’t have to be final/finished but you should have an idea of
how you want things to work, how you want it to look and start designing, testing and experimenting.

IMPORTANT - designers MUST contribute to the repository directly, on their own design branch. You MAY NOT deliver design work via
social media, or your partner’s commits, or deviate from the workflow best practices in any way. Create your artwork, add and commit
it via Github. Failure to follow the correct workflow as outlined in the Authoring class will result in a (substantial) grade reduction.
Sprint 2: Drag and drop, audio, design improvements
Implement drag and drop functionality; get your audio synced and playback working. Designers should be replacing any FPO (for
position only) assets with real artwork and doing any other design changes that need to be finished.

Sprint 3: Final touches / improvements
At this point you should be crushing any final bugs that pop up, doing any final design tweaks, and lots of testing / fixing. Responsive
fixes would occur here as well - make sure you’re testing on lots of different screen sizes.
