# Music Mixer Assignment
Made by Meet Parmar

This is the basic framework for our Music Mixer assignment. I plan to play the music of 6 different musical instruments then organize the SVG's inside the image.

## TABLE OF CONTENTS

### assets
Contains Dev Notes which provides  an rough Idea about the music mixer project in details.

### images
Contains 6 images that will represent the MP3s we can drag and drop, and a pause/play button.

### Code (Under contruction)
The code has hardly any functionality in it as of yet.
Although the content is in the HTML, it is not organised in any way and is merely there to test how the content would appear next to one another.
